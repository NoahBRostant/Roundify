###### (Discontinued as of 2022)

Welcome to the Roundify README, your guide to customizing the look of your display edges with a touch of elegance. Crafted with the Windows 11 Fluent theme in mind, Roundify introduces smoothly rounded corners to your display, enhancing your user interface with a modern aesthetic. This customization tool is compatible with Windows 7 and newer versions, given Rainmeter is installed on your system.

## Installation Requirements

- **Rainmeter**: Essential for the operation of Roundify. Ensure Rainmeter is installed on your system before proceeding with Roundify's setup.

## Features

Roundify offers a suite of customization options to personalize your desktop experience:

- **Corner Radius** 
- **Corner Colour**
- **Enable Fullscreen Corners**
- **Enable Settings Button**

**VISIT THE WIKI FOR MORE DETAILED INFORMATION**

## Usage

To access the settings menu for the first time, navigate your mouse to the very bottom right corner of your display and click. This action reveals the settings menu where all customization options can be found and adjusted.

### Exiting Roundify

To quit the application:
1. Open the Settings menu.
2. Click "Quit" and then "Quit" again to confirm.

Alternatively, removing Rainmeter from your app settings will also remove Roundify (note that this action will remove all other Rainmeter skins).
