##### (Discontinued as of 2022)

Welcome to the Roundify README, your guide to customizing the look of your display edges with a touch of elegance. Crafted with the Windows 11 Fluent theme in mind, Roundify introduces smoothly rounded corners to your display, enhancing your user interface with a modern aesthetic. This customization tool is compatible with Windows 7 and newer versions, given Rainmeter is installed on your system.

## Installation Requirements

- **Rainmeter**: Essential for the operation of Roundify. Ensure Rainmeter is installed on your system before proceeding with Roundify's setup.

## Features

Roundify offers a suite of customization options to personalize your desktop experience:

- **Corner Radius**: Adjustable from 0 to 100, allowing for complete control over the curvature of your display's corners.
- **Corner Colour**: A dedicated Colour Picker menu (separate, free download courtesy of jsmorley) enables you to customize the corner color to your liking.
- **Enable Fullscreen Corners**: Keeps the rounded corners active even when an application is in fullscreen mode, ensuring a consistent aesthetic.
- **Enable Settings Button**: A discreet button located in the bottom left corner for easy access to the settings menu.

## Usage

To access the settings menu for the first time, navigate your mouse to the very bottom right corner of your display and click. This action reveals the settings menu where all customization options can be found and adjusted.

### Exiting Roundify

To quit the application:
1. Open the Settings menu.
2. Click "Quit" and then "Quit" again to confirm.

Alternatively, removing Rainmeter from your app settings will also remove Roundify (note that this action will remove all other Rainmeter skins).
