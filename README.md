## What is Roundify?

Roundify is an application/skin built for Rainmeter that allows the user to change the corner radius of their display. Roundify allows for a high level of customizability and we're just getting started with it.

Roundify utilizes Rainmeter to create rounded edges to your screen and/or windows. I decided to use Rainmeter as it seemed like a very versatile program to write in and allowed me to very quickly create something out of nothing.

This is however my first time programing a Rainmeter program so there was a lot to learn. Rainmeter does have a very strong and helpful community that helped me along the way and I'll give special thanks to those [here](#special-thanks).

## Features

- Corner Radius (Can be set between 0 - 100).
- Corner Colour (Opens a powerful colour picker called Colour Picker+).
- Enable Full-screen Corners. (When an app is in full screen keep the rounded corners on).
- Enable Settings Button. (The hidden button in the bottom left to open the settings menu).
- Padding (Add padding to the edges of your display).
- Updater (Keeps track of new updates and allows you to update directly from the app).
- Downdater (Allows you to return to a previous version directly from the skin).
