# Roundify

Hello There Customizer,

This skin is allows you to easily create rounded edges to the edges of your display Following the new Windows 11 Fluent theme. It should work on Windows 7+ so long as you install Rainmeter.
The skin is relatively simple in concept, however, I have given you all the tools in the settings menu to change and adapt the corners as you see fit.
All parameters can be found in the settings menu which can be first accessed by moving your mouse the the very bottom right corner of your display (as far as it can go) and clicking. This should bring up a Settings menu.

Rainmeter is Required!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Current Features:
- Corner Radius. (Can be set between 0 - 100)
- Corner Colour. (Opens a Colour Picker menu which can be downloaded separately for free curtesy of jsmorley)
- Enable Fullscreen Corners. (When an app is in full screen keep the rounded corners on)
- Enable Settings Button. (The hidden button in the bottom left to open the settings menu)

If at any point you wish to quit the app completely you can open the Settings menu and click "Quit" and then "Quit" again.
or you can remove Rainmeter from your app settings. (NOTE: all other Rainmeter skins will also be removed)
