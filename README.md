## What is Roundify?

Roundify is an application/skin built for Rainmeter that allows the user to change the corner radius of their display. Roundify allows for a high level of customizability and we're just getting started with it.

- What your application does,

- Why you used the technologies you used,

- Some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future.

## Features

- Corner Radius (Can be set between 0 - 100).
- Corner Colour (Opens a <a href="https://forum.rainmeter.net/viewtopic.php?t=26884">Colour Picker</a> menu by <a href="https://github.com/jsmorley">@jsmorley</a>).
- Enable Fullscreen Corners. (When an app is in full screen keep the rounded corners on).
- Enable Settings Button. (The hidden button in the bottom left to open the settings menu).
- Padding (Add padding to the edges of your display).
- Updater (Keeps track of new updates and allows you to update directly from the app).
- Downdater (Allows you to return to a previous version directly from the skin).
